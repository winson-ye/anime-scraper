# anime-scraper

The purpose of this project is to collect the top 50 most popular anime from MAL. The data is collected in the form of links and saved as a simple text file in the working directory. For now, my goal is just to learn more about HTML and web scraping.

## Planned Features
1. Have a bot periodically check if the top 50 have changed
2. Allow users to query this list to see if their favorite anime is in the top 50
3. Allow users to collect the top k anime links, where k is provided by the user
